A python library for controlling the [iRobot
Create 2](http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx). This was used
in ECE 387 Introduction to Robotics class I taught at the US Air Force Academy.

- [video](https://vimeo.com/266619301): robot could only follow the black tap road and couldn't run into anything. If anything got in the way, it had to naviage around it to its final destination

## Install

### pip

The recommended way to install this library is:

```bash
pip install pycreate2
```

### Development

If you wish to develop and submit git-pulls, you can do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2
cd pycreate2
poetry install
poetry run pytest -v
```

Build: 


```bash
poetry build
pip install  ..\dist\pycreate2-0.8.0.tar.gz
```


## Use

There are multiple ways to command the Create to move, here are some
examples:

```python
from  pycreate2 import Create2
import time

# Create a Create2.
port = "/dev/serial"  # where is your serial port?
bot = Create2(port)

# Start the Create 2
bot.start()

# Put the Create2 into 'safe' mode so we can drive it
# This will still provide some protection
bot.safe()

# You are responsible for handling issues, no protection/safety in
# this mode ... becareful
bot.full()

# directly set the motor speeds ... move forward
bot.drive_direct(100, 100)
time.sleep(2)

# turn in place
bot.drive_direct(200,-200)  # inputs for motors are +/- 500 max
time.sleep(2)

# Stop the bot
bot.drive_stop()

# query some sensors
sensors = bot.get_sensors()  # returns all data
print(sensors.light_bumper_left)

# Close the connection
# bot.close()
```

More examples are found in the [examples
folder](https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2/tree/master/examples).

## Documents

Additional notes and documents are in the [docs

### Modes

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walchko/pycreate2/master/pics/create_modes.png)

The different modes (OFF, PASSIVE, SAFE, and FULL) can be switched
between by calling different commands.

  - **OFF:** The robot is off and can charge, it will accept no commands
  - **PASSIVE:** The robot is in standbye and can charge. It will send
    sensor packets, but will not move
  - **SAFE:** The robot will not charge, but you full control over it
    with a few exceptions. If the cliff sensors or wheel drop sensors
    are triggered, the robot goes back to PASSIVE mode.
  - **FULL:** The robot will not charge and you have full control. You
    are responsible to handle any response due to cliff, wheel drop or
    any other sensors.

### Sensor Data

Sensor data is returned as a `namedtuple` from `collections`. The
information can be accessed as either:

```python
sensors = bot.get_sensors()
sensors.wall == sensors[1]  # True
```
